<h1>Salesforce</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>Today we're starting to learn about Salesforce, which is an interface to a database. First we're learning about what a database is.</p>

<h1>Databases</h1>

<p>A database is an organized collection of data. The name refers to the data and how it's organized, which is different from the software that's used to access the data. That's called a DBMS or "database management system." The name "database" is commonly used to refer both to the database and DBMS.</p>

<p>Databases are usually "served" by dedicated computers that run only the DBMS software. But you can create a database on any computer that has DBMS software like</p>

<p>Oracle</p>
<p>Microsoft Access</p>
<p>SQL</p>
<p>Apache Derby</p>
<p>Salesforce is hosted in the cloud, and the interface is web-based. New database software and services are popping up all the time, like this one I just found advertised at the top of the Google search for "database."</p>

<h3>What are they used for?</h3>

<p>Organizations use databases to hold administrative information, data regarding customers and suppliers, engineering data, inventory, economic models. Many content management systems use databases to store webpages.</p>

<p>Are databases the same as Spreadsheets?</p>

<p>Databases and spreadsheets are both used to store and manage sets of data, and for both the basic content is a set of data values. But while spreadsheets store data values in cells, a database typically stores values in tables.</p>

<p>A spreadsheet is usually a single file, and access is limited to one user at a time. In contrast, a database is a set of data values, not a file, and more than one user can have access to it.</p>

<p>Sometimes the output of a database is presented in the form of a spreadsheet, with the contents of the tables being put in the cells of the spreadsheet.</p>

<h1>What is Salesforce?</h1>

<p>Salesforce is a company headquartered in San Francisco. Their revenue comes from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) product, also named Salesforce. The company is so successful they are building a huge "Salesforce Tower," which, at 61 floors and 1,000 feet in height, will be the tallest building in San Francisco. It's scheduled to be finished in 2018 at a cost of $1.1 billion!</p>

<p>Is Salesforce a database, a DBMS, or a CRM, or all three?</p>

<p>Salesforce seems to think it can be both a database and a CRM. It describes its "Sales Cloud" product as a CRM because it stores customer information and its social media app, Chatter, lets you collaborate with other departments in order to best serve customers.</p>

<p>Of course, all that information is stored in a database! But that's like calling Google a database. It's more about interacting with the data. Doesn't that mean Salesforce is also a DBMS?</p>

<p>The short answer is Salesforce is a CRM, because the point is to support the sales department with info on customers. But it saves a ton of data in a structured form, in a database! (One of the important tasks we'll perform as Salesforce admins is uploading data to Salesforce.) Our main goal as Salesforce admins will be to support a sales department with customer information. But fairly often we'll be reminded that we're interacting with a database, even writing the occasional formula to filter data.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<h2>We get to use Salesforce!</h2>

<p>Today we went to the Trailhead tutorials for Salesforce and signed up for a free Salesforce developer account. Then we started going through the hands-on tutorials that simulate being a Salesforce admin: creating Accounts, Users and Objects and customizing them.</p>

<!-- media -->

<p>It's a complicated interface, but I found myself going to "Setup" at the top of the screen and the "Build" menu on the left of the screen every time.</p>

<h1>Day 3</h1>

<h3>Leads and Opportunities</h3>

<p>Today we started off by doing a Trailhead challenge on Working with Leads and Opportunities. I learned about the Accounts and Contacts display, and how it helps salespeople. I didn't know you could integrate your Twitter account into Salesforce! I also learned about the Kanban view, which draws your attention to deals requiring your attention, like opportunities without an associated activity.</p>

I took the quiz and earned 100 points!</p>

<!-- media -->

<p>I created a new Opportunity and added myself to the Opportunity team. Because my "org" is new it has no Accounts, so I had to manually add an account. It was good practice: I created the Python Software Foundation.</p>

<!-- media -->

<p>To complete the challenge I had to enable Opportunity Teams and add myself to the team.</p>

<!-- media -->

<p>I checked over the challenge and submitted it. I got it right!</p>

<!-- media -->

<p>The Answer about Accounts and Opportunities</p>

<p>What I discoved about Opportunities was:

<p>Coming soon!</p>

<!-- media -->
<p>Got setup with Slack group messaging system. Wrote a message.</p>
<!-- media -->
<p>Create an Opportunity, Account, Lead, Contact in Salesforce.</p>
